<p>
  YAMZ (pronounced "yams") is an open vocabulary of metadata terms
  from all domains and from all parts of "metadata speech". That
  will be exciting the
  <a href="#more">more about metadata</a> you know.
</p>

<p>
  In brief, with no login required, anyone can search for and link
  to terms. Login to create and edit your terms, and to comment on
  others' terms.
  <a href="/guidelines">Community guidelines</a> help make
  the metadictionary a high-quality cross-domain metadata
  lexicon that is directly connected to evolving user needs.
</p>

<h4>From specialized projects</h4>
<p>
  Almost every software project needs controlled vocabularies for
  interacting with users. Effort that goes into devising a set
  of terms for a search interface, a dropdown pick list, a form
  for entering data, etc. involves researching, consensus building,
  and communicating. YAMZ provides
  a platform for you to take advantage of prior work and to share
  your own new or divergent work with others, whether you are one
  developer making UI design choices or a large working group
  creating a formal ontology.
</p>

<h4>... to international standards</h4>
<p>
  Maintaining and developing international standards is normally
  an expensive, inefficient, design-by-committee process producing
  results that are out-of-date as soon as they are published.
  With the metadictionary, change will be rapid and affordable,
  driven by practitioners and active testers. There will be no
  need for panels of busy experts to convene and deliberate. We
  expect dramatic simplification of vocabulary evolution compared
  to traditional methods. Before YAMZ, it was hard for one group
  to learn about the efforts of another group, which has resulted
  in a large number of overlapping, conflicting
  vocabularies. YAMZ
  is not the first crowdsourced metadata dictionary, but as a
  shelter for living, changing machine-readable terminology, it
  is not unlike Yet Another Metadata Zoo.
</p>

<p>
  The hope is that users &ndash; people creating and receiving
  machine-readable descriptions of objects they care about &ndash;
  will be able to find
  most of the terms they need in <i>one place</i> namely, the
  metadictionary. One vocabulary, one namespace. This should
  reduce the number of namespaces and the
  expense of maintaining crosswalks with other vocabularies.
  And the vocabulary is completely ready for linked data applications,
  each term having its own permalink (an ARK identifier).
</p>

<h3>Basic metadictionary structure</h3>

<p>
  Across YAMZ there are three disjoint term classes.
  Classification is ongoing and fully-automated, based on voting
  and user reputation.

  <h4>Vernacular</h4>
  <li>all terms are born here and considered to be works-in-progress</li>
  <li>unstable terms; permalink points to a definition that may change</li>
  <li>anyone can propose new vernacular terms</li>
  <li>proposer(s) of a term "own" it initially; only they can make changes</li>
  <li>communities of interest spring up around related term clusters</li>
  <li>term tagging make it easy for communities (eg, working groups) to switch focus to selected term subsets</li>

  <h4>Canonical</h4>
  <li>terms safe for short- or long-term reference</li>
  <li>stable terms; permalink points to an unchanging definition</li>
  <li>terms move from vernacular to canonical by consensus</li>
  <li>terms still subject to voting</li>

  <h4>Deprecated</h4>
  <li>stable terms, but deprecated for long-term reference</li>
  <li>terms move from canonical to archival by consensus</li>
  <li>archival terms have links such as "ObsoletedBy: term X"</li>

<h3>Some background</h3>

<h4>Metadata and data</h4>
<p>
  Metadata is structured information for describing things we care about.
  It looks like text with extra punctuation to mark different regions,
  and elements and values within those regions. That structure makes the
  information readable by software, which in turn helps us organize,
  manage, analyze, and discover things we care about.
</p>
<p>
  Real computational power comes when there is wide agreement on metadata
  terms, such as element names and the values they take on. The goal of
  YAMZ is to support finding, creating, and achieving community accord on
  high-quality terms. These are the terms that you and others will use
  to create high-quality metadata. Unlike a regular dictionary, the
  metadictionary is therefore about terms used to create <i>structured</i>
  (machine-readable) information.
</p>
<p>
  The metadictionary supports data too. Like metadata, data is structured
  information, but with a shift in emphasis away from being <i>about</i> a
  particular thing. Some people say there's no important difference
  between data and metadata.
</p>

<h4>Assertions about things</h4>
<p>
  Metadata looks like a group of assertions about a particular thing, such
  as a document. For example, metadata may assert that a given document's
  title is X, its author Y, and its publication date Z.
</p>
<p>
  It's not always obvious what thing a metadata assertion is about.
  Term definitions often refer to it with a word like "thing", "resource",
  or "object". Thus a "title" element might be defined as "a name given
  to the resource". Which exact "resource" won't be found in a term
  definition but is revealed elsewhere in the metadata or by context.
  For example, metadata embedded in a JPEG file is usually assumed to
  describe an image embedded in the same file, and a metadata record often
  has a special place to hold an identifier for the object being described.
</p>

<h4>Elements and values</h4>
<p>
  Lots of terms define metadata/data elements, which are small categories
  of information, such as "title", "author", or "response". An element
  might also be a structured statement that itself contains other elements.
  A "location" element might contain "latitude" and "longitude" elements.
  Other elements are meant to take on metadata/data values, for example,
  pieces of text or personal names.
</p>
<p>
  Terms help identify metadata/data values, especially when they are
  limited in some way. For example, a "response" element might be one of
  "yes", "no", or "maybe". A "count" element might take an infinite number
  of values, but always restricted to "integer".
</p>

<h4>Openness</h4>
<p>
  All YAMZ content &ndash; terms, definitions, examples, illustrations,
  etc. &ndash; are dedicated to the public domain under the terms of
  the CC0 license. The source code for the metadictionary is
  available on
  <a href="https://www.github.com/metadata-research/yamz">Github</a> as a Python
  package under a BSD open source license.
  Full <a href="/api">API documentation</a> is also available.
</p>

<h3>Getting Involved</h3>
<p>
  We welcome developers and analysts to help us improve YAMZ. If you have
  interests and skills in metadata standards, database service and schema
  design, or YAMZ core technologies (currently Postgres, Python, Flask),
  please let us know via the github repo above. Sometimes there are
  internships available as listed
  <a href="https://mrc.cci.drexel.edu/yamz-metadata-dictionary/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  YAMZ was initially developed in 2013-2014 by the Metadata Working
  Group of the NSF-funded
  <a href="http://www.dataone.org">DataONE</a> initiative.
  Working group members were John Kunze (chair), Jane Greenberg (chair),
  Christopher Patton (lead developer), Karthik Ram, Greg Janée,
  Nassib Nassar, Angela Murillo, Sarah Callaghan, Rob Guralnick,
  and Tim Robertson. Since then enhancements have been made by
  Dillon Arévalo, Mark Phillips, and Chris Rauch, with support from the
  <a href="https://www.diglib.org">Digital Library Federation (DLF)</a>, the
  <a href="https://www.esipfed.org/">Earth Science Information Partners
     (ESIP)</a>, the
  <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/">Wilson Center</a>, the
  <a href="https://www.imls.gov/">Institute of Museum and Library Services</a>,
  and especially the Drexel University
  <a href="https://mrc.cci.drexel.edu/">Metadata Research Center</a>.
